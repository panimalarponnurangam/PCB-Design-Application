# Aim
To Design a PCB Design Application .

# Software required
Eagle

# Procedure
1. Open a new schematic file within your project.</br>
2. Use the libraries provided in EAGLE or create custom libraries if necessary.</br>
3. Place components onto the schematic sheet by using the 'Add' tool.</br>
4. Connect the components using the 'Net' tool.</br>
5. Label nets appropriately to ensure clarity</br>
6. Once routing is complete, perform a ERC to ensure there are no errors and save the schematic.</br>
7. Click on the 'Generate/Switch to Board' icon to create a board from your schematic.</br>
8. EAGLE's board layout editor allows you to place components, route traces, and define board shapes.</br>
9. Arrange components on the board to optimize space usage and minimize signal interference.</br>
10. Route traces to connect components according to your schematic.</br>
11. Use the various routing and editing tools provided by EAGLE to ensure proper routing and avoid design rule violations.</br>
12. Once routing is complete, perform a design rule check (DRC) to ensure there are no errors and save the board layout.</br>
13. Go to File > CAM Processor and set up CAM jobs to generate Gerber files for your PCB layers.</br>
14. Verify generated files to ensure they contain all necessary information.</br>
15. Save the generated manufacturing files.</br>

# Theory

A touch sensor is a type of device that captures and records physical touch or embrace on a device and/or object. 
It enables a device or object to detect touch or near proximity, typically by a human user or operator. Touch sensing input devices
offer numerous possibilities for novel interaction techniques and it reliably replaces mechanical buttons and switches to eliminate 
mechanical wear and tear. These can be configured into simple sliders, rotary wheels, or touch pads for intuitive user interfaces. 
A touch sensor primarily works when an object or individual gets in physical contact with it. Touch sensors are also called as 
tactile sensors and are sensitive to touch, force or pressure. It can be implemented using Capacitive or Resistive sensing technology.


### Working 

A touch sensor circuit is an electrical component that detects the presence or proximity of a conductive object, such as a human finger. 
It operates on the principle of capacitance, where the sensor electrode forms a capacitor with the object. When the object touches or 
approaches the electrode, the capacitance changes, which is detected by a measurement circuit. The circuit converts this change into a 
digital signal that can be processed by a microcontroller or computer. The touch sensor circuit is a simple, reliable, and cost-effective 
solution for various applications, including touch screens, human-machine interfaces, and industrial automation. The area of the sensor 
electrode and the thickness of the cover material affect the touch capacitance, and the measurement circuit is an example of a
capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC).
